Hi, This is the code that gets the best result.

Please add the river_data and weather_data etc to this file and you can run.

You need to stations (river) file to run the code. You also need to libraries specified in the beginning of the file. 

To create stations file you can run the "river data exploration.ipynb"

You can just run the "Liner Regression Model.ipynb"
